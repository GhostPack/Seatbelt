    'Seatbelt.exe "<Command> [argument]"' will pass an argument to a command that supports it (note the quotes).
    'Seatbelt.exe -group=all' will run ALL enumeration checks, can be combined with "-full".
    'Seatbelt.exe <Command> -computername=COMPUTER.DOMAIN.COM [-username=DOMAIN\USER -password=PASSWORD]' will run an applicable check remotely
    'Seatbelt.exe -group=remote -computername=COMPUTER.DOMAIN.COM [-username=DOMAIN\USER -password=PASSWORD]' will run remote specific checks
    'Seatbelt.exe -group=system -outputfile="C:\Temp\out.txt"' will run system checks and output to a .txt file.
    'Seatbelt.exe -group=user -q -outputfile="C:\Temp\out.json"' will run in quiet mode with user checks and output to a .json file.
```

**Note:** searches that target users will run for the current user if not-elevated and for ALL users if elevated.

**A more detailed wiki is coming...**


## Command Groups

**Note:** many commands do some type of filtering by default. Supplying the `-full` argument prevents filtering output. Also, the command group `all` will run all current checks.

For example, the following command will run ALL checks and returns ALL output:

`Seatbelt.exe -group=all -full`

| RPCMappedEndpoints | Current RPC endpoints mapped |
| ScheduledTasks | Scheduled tasks (via WMI) that aren't authored by 'Microsoft', "full" dumps all Scheduled tasks |
| SearchIndex | Query results from the Windows Search Index, default term of 'passsword'. (argument(s) == \<search path\> \<pattern1,pattern2,...\> |
| SecurityPackages | Enumerates the security packages currently available using EnumerateSecurityPackagesA() |
| SysmonEvents | Sysmon process creation logs (1) with sensitive data. |


### Additional Command Groups

Executed with: `Seatbelt.exe -group=GROUPNAME`

| Alias | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Slack | Runs modules that start with "Slack*" |
| Chrome | Runs modules that start with "Chrome*" |
| Remote | Runs the following modules (for use against a remote system): AMSIProviders, AntiVirus, DotNet, ExplorerRunCommands, Hotfixes, InterestingProcesses, LastShutdown, LogonSessions, LSASettings, MappedDrives, NetworkProfiles, NetworkShares, NTLMSettings, PowerShell, ProcessOwners, PuttyHostKeys, PuttySessions, RDPSavedConnections, RDPSessions, RDPsettings, Sysmon, WindowsDefender, WindowsEventForwarding, WindowsFirewall |


## Command Arguments

Command that accept arguments have it noted in their description. To pass an argument to a command, enclose the command an arguments in double quotes.

For example, the following command returns 4624 logon events for the last 30 days:

`Seatbelt.exe "LogonEvents 30"`

The following command queries a registry three levels deep, returning only keys/valueNames/values that match the regex `.*defini.*`, and ignoring any errors that occur.

`Seatbelt.exe "reg \"HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\" 3 .*defini.* true"`


## Output

Seatbelt can redirect its output to a file with the `-outputfile="C:\Path\file.txt"` argument. If the file path ends in .json, the output will be structured json.

For example, the following command will output the results of system checks to a txt file:

`Seatbelt.exe -group=system -outputfile="C:\Temp\system.txt"`


## Remote Enumeration

Commands noted with a + in the help menu can be run remotely against another system. This is performed over WMI via queries for WMI classes and WMI's StdRegProv for registry enumeration.

To enumerate a remote system, supply `-computername=COMPUTER.DOMAIN.COM` - an alternate username and password can be specified with `-username=DOMAIN\USER -password=PASSWORD`

For example, the following command runs remote-focused checks against a remote system:

`Seatbelt.exe -group=remote -computername=192.168.230.209 -username=THESHIRE\sam -password="yum \"po-ta-toes\""`


## Building Your Own Modules

Seatbelt's structure is completely modular, allowing for additional command modules to be dropped into the file structure and loaded up dynamically.

There is a commented command module template at `.\Seatbelt\Commands\Template.cs` for reference. Once built, drop the module in the logical file location, include it in the project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, and compile.


## Compile Instructions

We are not planning on releasing binaries for Seatbelt, so you will have to compile yourself.

Seatbelt has been built against .NET 3.5 and 4.0 with C# 8.0 features and is compatible with [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Simply open up the project .sln, choose "release", and build. To change the target .NET framework version, [modify the project's settings](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/issues/27) and rebuild the project.
